To Do:
1) Look into GPU performance degradation. For now Agent runs on CPU (which is still very fast)
2) Keep testing the agent on continuous action space OpenAI Gym environments (mujoco environments have some good options to be explored)
3) Look into optimizatoin techniques from OpenAI baselines and consider adding if necessary
